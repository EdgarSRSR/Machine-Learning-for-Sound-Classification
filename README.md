# Machine-Learning-for-Sound-Classification
A collection of files for audio classification using Machine Learning

These files have python based programs that help creating models for audio classification using Machine Learning.
The algorithms used for audio classifications are based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Networks.
To do this it is required to get parameters like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) or spectograms tracking the frequencies across time. On these files there is code that helps to create these spectograms as well as parameters of audio analysis like MFCC, Fast Fourier Transforms, Zero Crossing Rate, Spectral Roll-Offs, etc.
